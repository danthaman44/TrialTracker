In the future, we would like to implement

1. An ability to users to register and join sites. For example,
CRC's at Duke can affiliate with a site called "Duke University Medical Center"
Sites will be able to collaborate on trials, and data collection between sites may be
gamified. Each site will have a directory of all its members, allowing for easy communication.

2. The categories in which data is recorded will be dynamic. 
Users will be able to add the the exisiting six categories provided

3. Users will have custom account pages where they will be able
to edit their account settings and upload an avatar

4. Users will be able to customize the look of the site on the front end
with custom avatars and background colors. 

5. The look/UI of the site will be improved significantly. We
will have a real logo, and incorporate CSS libraries 
besides Twitter Bootstrap. The site will also be responsive
on multiple browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, IE, and Safari.

6. The site will have a custom domain name

7. We will have a beautiful landing page for the site that includes information
about the project for CRC's to view
