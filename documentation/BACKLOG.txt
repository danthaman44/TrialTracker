In the future, we would like to implement

1. An ability to users to register and join sites. For example,
CRC's at Duke can affiliate with a site called "Duke University Medical Center"
Sites will be able to collaborate on trials, and data collection between sites may be
gamified. Each site will have a directory of all its members, allowing for easy communication.

2. The categories in which data is recorded will be dynamic. 
Users will be able to add the the exisiting sixe categories provided

3. Users will have custom account pages where they will be able
to edit their account settings and upload an avatar
