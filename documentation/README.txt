1. Your project's purpose

 The purpose of our project was to create a simple, elegant looking 
 website to simplify the clinical trial data collection process for 
 clinical research coordinators. We created an app than allows them 
 to input their weekly data and view it graphically. 


2. Your project's dependencies (libraries, versions of software, etc.)

Our website using Ruby on Rails version 3.2.11. For front end markup, we used
Twitter Bootstrap CSS library version 2.2.2. Our graphs were created Google Chart Tools. 
Our production environment uses PostgreSQL database and is hosted on Heroku. 
The development environment uses a SQLite database.


 3. How to deploy your project
 Our website is already deployed at trialtracker.herokuapp.com. Anybody can access it.
 At present, the site is best deployed through git. Alternatively,
 if a user has Ruby on Rails setup on their system, they can download the project
 from a zip file. Regardless, this project requires some knowledge of the command line 
 to set up. Running the localhost server can only be done from the commmand line with 
 "rails server" command, once user has cd into the proper directory
